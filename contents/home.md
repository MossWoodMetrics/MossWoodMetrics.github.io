We tackle the challenges that hinder scientific research and factual reporting. We aim to address issues like project reproducability, transparency, bias, limited data (underpowered studies), and quality control. 

Underpowered studies and research bias are well-documented issues in academia. Additionally, there is  reproducability crises, with many studies either never being repdroduced, snd others not being possible to reproducs. Further scientists and researchers are tired,and are losing in existing peer review system and structure.

### FluidFindings proposes an alternative approach:

* ***Live, Curated Datasets:*** Our system ensures data quality and traceability through strict contribution rules and real-time analysis.
  
* ***Incentivized Participation:*** We reward project creators, data contributors, and reviewers to enhance research reliability through compensated reviews.

* ***Short, Data-Driven Stories:*** We present complex information in clear and concise formats, aiming to reduce reading time and improve knowledge absorption.

* ***Interactive Interfaces:*** Our platform utilizes innovative features like the "place in time" interface to present research findings in a more engaging and interactive
  
* ***Increase Sample Sizes & Reduce Bias:*** We encourage more researchers to contribute data points, effectively addressing underpowered studies and reducing the potential for bias.
  
* ***Rigorous Methodologies:***  Research integrity is ensured through pre-defined protocols, robust analysis techniques, and open access to code. This transparency strengthens verification and replication of findings.

This approach aims to significantly improve the research landscape by fostering a more collaborative, trustworthy, and less biased environment for scientific discovery.
