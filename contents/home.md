Here at MossWoodMetrics our goal is to present scientific, factual, and referenceable data in more intuitive ways. 

which aim to improve the scientific procces by increasing transparency, and dealing with problems of repeatability and changing levels of significance, as well as offering solutions to the diminishing effectiveness of the peer review proccess.

We believe that data from scientific, historical, or social sources, amongst others, is most powerful when it tells short, concise stories, which can change as the data changes, all whilst being referenceable during and after every iteration of the data.

Our idea, derives itself from some of the big problems in science. Mainly repeatability, transparency, and the diminsihing effectiveness of the peer review proccess. By having live datasets, which can only be contributed too using scrict rulesets, we believe we make science more repeatable. By allowing for quick corrections we believe we make datasets more reliable. By paying data reviewers, we believe we make  

ith live analysis as the data updates, 

Our experience is mainly from a scientific standpoint, whereby we see scientific reports showing results from a small cross-section of time. 

One of the problems with publishing is repeatability.

- Deliver news and current events

We integrate data analytics and reporting, and teach your team to do the same. We make "place-in-time" dashboards, which is our fresh approach to presenting information better.
