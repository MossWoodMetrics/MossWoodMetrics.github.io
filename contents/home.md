FluidFindings offers a fresh approach to research and factual results reporting. 

We address key challenges such as project repeatability, transparency, project bias, underpowered projects, and quality control. 

Scientific results are not static, like research manuscripts suggest. Underpowered studies are common, and research bias is well known phenomenon. There is also an increasing inability to reproduce results, and a reduction in faith of the current structure of the peer review proccess. 

By having more researchers, contributing more data points, under the instruction of strict methadologies, and rewarding them sufficiently along with peer reviewers, we believe we can offer an alternative to the established academic framework.
