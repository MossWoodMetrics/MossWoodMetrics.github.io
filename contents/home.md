FluidFindings offers a fresh approach to academia, research, and factual reporting. 

We address key challenges such as project repeatability, transparency, project bias, underpowered projects, and quality control. 

Scientific results are not static, like research manuscripts suggest. Underpowered (sample size too low) studies are common, and research bias is well known phenomenon, aswell as the increasing inability to reproduce results. 

By having more researchers, contributing more data points, under the instruction of strict methadologies, and rewarding them sufficiently along with peer reviewers, we believe we can offer an alternative to the established academic framework.
